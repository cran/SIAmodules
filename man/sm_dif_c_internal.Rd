\description{
This is the internal documentation of your module that is not included in the
help index of the package. You may include your notes here. For \link[=sm_dif_c]{user-facing help page}, please edit the entry in the YAML.
}
\details{
Even being internal, a user can still discover this help page. To prevent
that, include the \verb{@noRd} roxygen2 tag below (in the source \code{.R} file).

If your module uses any external packages, such as ggplot2,
\strong{you have to declare the imports} with the \verb{@importFrom} tag and include
the package in the DESCRIPTION. See
\url{https://r-pkgs.org/dependencies-in-practice.html} for more details.
